# FailureToDelivers

Per [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ms6mvf/latest_failuretodeliver_data_from_all_72_etfs/), this repo simply exists to show open source analysis of publicly-available data.

The underlying data is found on [the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) and the post in question was generated using "March 2021, second half" on 4/16/21.

ETF data is pulled from ETF.com, an entity that looks-- [as far as I can tell](https://lookup.icann.org/lookup)-- based in the US

## CAVEAT(s)

manifes7o: I haven't done any of the analysis myself, I merely reformatted OP's code for clarity. **MORE THAN WELCOME** to any feedback/constructive criticism

Moreover, this data is only as recent as 3/31/21. Which, by my count, leaves 11 business days for the underlying information to change dramatically. I'd implore you **NOT TO MAKE RASH DECISIONS ON THIS DATA**, as it is nearly two weeks out of date.
